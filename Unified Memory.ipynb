    "The [*CUDA Best Practices Guide*](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#memory-optimizations), a highly recommended followup to this and other CUDA fundamentals labs, recommends a design cycle called **APOD**: **A**ssess, **P**arallelize, **O**ptimize, **D**eploy. In short, APOD prescribes an iterative design process, where developers can apply incremental improvements to their accelerated application's performance, and ship their code. As developers become more competent CUDA programmers, more advanced optimization techniques can be applied to their accelerated code bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will support such a style of iterative development. You will be using the Nsight Systems command line tool **nsys** to qualitatively measure your application's performance, and to identify opportunities for optimization, after which you will apply incremental improvements before learning new techniques and repeating the cycle. As a point of focus, many of the techniques you will be learning and applying in this lab will deal with the specifics of how CUDA's **Unified Memory** works. Understanding Unified Memory behavior is a fundamental skill for CUDA developers, and serves as a prerequisite to many more advanced memory management techniques."

    "\n",
    "The only way to be assured that attempts at optimizing accelerated code bases are actually successful is to profile the application for quantitative information about the application's performance. `nsys` is the Nsight Systems command line tool. It ships with the CUDA toolkit, and is a powerful tool for profiling accelerated applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "`nsys` is easy to use. Its most basic usage is to simply pass it the path to an executable compiled with `nvcc`. `nsys` will proceed to execute the application, after which it will print a summary output of the application's GPU activities, CUDA API calls, as well as information about **Unified Memory** activity, a topic which will be covered extensively later in this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "When accelerating applications, or optimizing already-accelerated applications, take a scientific and iterative approach. Profile your application after making changes, take note, and record the implications of any refactoring on performance. Make these observations early and often: frequently, enough performance boost can be gained with little effort such that you can ship your accelerated application. Additionally, frequent profiling will teach you how specific changes to your CUDA code bases impact its actual performance: knowledge that is hard to acquire when only profiling after many kinds of changes in your code bases."

When either the host or device attempts to access the memory, a [page fault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_fault) will occur, at which point the host or device will migrate the needed data in batches. Similarly, at any point when the CPU, or any GPU in the accelerated system, attempts to access memory not yet resident on it, page faults will occur and trigger its migration.\n",

    "The ability to page fault and migrate memory on demand is tremendously helpful for ease of development in your accelerated applications. Additionally, when working with data that exhibits sparse access patterns, for example when it is impossible to know which data will be required to be worked on until the application actually runs, and for scenarios when data might be accessed by multiple GPU devices in an accelerated system with multiple GPUs, on-demand memory migration is remarkably beneficial.\n",

    "\n",
    "A powerful technique to reduce the overhead of page faulting and on-demand memory migrations, both in host-to-device and device-to-host memory transfers, is called **asynchronous memory prefetching**. Using this technique allows programmers to asynchronously migrate unified memory (UM) to any CPU or GPU device in the system, in the background, prior to its use by application code. By doing this, GPU kernels and CPU function performance can be increased on account of reduced page fault and on-demand data migration overhead.\n",

    "- Use the Nsight Systems command line tool (**nsys**) to profile accelerated application performance.\n",
    "- Leverage an understanding of **Streaming Multiprocessors** to optimize execution configurations.\n",
    "- Understand the behavior of **Unified Memory** with regard to page faulting and data migrations.\n",
    "- Use **asynchronous memory prefetching** to reduce page faults and data migrations for increased performance.\n",
    "- Employ an iterative development cycle to rapidly accelerate and deploy applications.\n",

    "\n",
    "A basic accelerated SAXPY (Single Precision a\\*x+b) application has been provided for you [here](../edit/09-saxpy/01-saxpy.cu). It currently contains a couple of bugs that you will need to find and fix before you can successfully compile, run, and then profile it with `nsys profile`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After fixing the bugs and profiling the application, record the runtime of the `saxpy` kernel and then work *iteratively* to optimize the application, using `nsys profile` after each iteration to notice the effects of the code changes on kernel performance and UM behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilize the techniques from this lab. To support your learning, utilize [effortful retrieval](http://sites.gsu.edu/scholarlyteaching/effortful-retrieval/) whenever possible, rather than rushing to look up the specifics of techniques from earlier in the lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your end goal is to profile an accurate `saxpy` kernel, without modifying `N`, to run in under *200us*. Check out [the solution](../edit/09-saxpy/solutions/02-saxpy-solution.cu) if you get stuck, and feel free to compile and profile it if you wish."
